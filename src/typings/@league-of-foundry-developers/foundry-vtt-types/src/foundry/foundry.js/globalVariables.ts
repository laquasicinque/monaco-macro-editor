For that reason, the correct types for these variables include the types for the\n * uninitialized state.\n *\n * While this is correct from a type checking perspective, it can be inconvenient to have to type guard these global\n * variables everywhere. Some users might prefer the convenience over the 100% correctness in type checking.\n *\n * For this reason, this interface provides a way for users to configure certain global variables to be typed more\n * leniently, i.e., as the types of their initialized state. This is done via declaration merging. To configure a\n * specific global variable to be typed leniently, the user simply needs to merge a property with the name of the\n * variable into this interface (the type doesn't matter).\n *\n * The currently supported variables are:\n * - {@link game}\n * - {@link socket}\n * - {@link canvas}\n *\n * @example\n * ```typescript\n * declare global {\n *   interface LenientGlobalVariableTypes {\n *     game: never; // the type doesn't matter\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * const referenceToGame: Game = game; // ok! :)\n * ```\n */interface LenientGlobalVariableTypes{}let vtt:'Foundry VTT';/**\n * @defaultValue `{}`\n * @remarks\n * Initialized between the `'DOMContentLoaded'` event and the `'init'` hook event.\n */let game:'game'extends keyof LenientGlobalVariableTypes?Game:Game|{};/**\n * @defaultValue `null`\n * @remarks\n * Initialized between the `'DOMContentLoaded'` event and the `'init'` hook event.\n */let socket:'socket'extends keyof LenientGlobalVariableTypes?io.Socket:io.Socket|null;/**\n * A collection of application instances\n * @remarks\n * - All of the elements of {@link ui} except for `context` and `window` are initialized between the `'setup'` and `'ready'` hook events.\n * - In the `/stream` view, only `chat` is initialized but none of the other {@link Application}s.\n */let ui:{/**\n * @remarks\n * Initialized whenever a {@link ContextMenu} is opened, deleted when it's closed again.\n */\ncontext?:ContextMenu;/**\n * @defaultValue `{}`\n */\nwindows:Record<number,Application>;}&{[Key in keyof CONFIG['ui']]?:InstanceType<CONFIG['ui'][Key]>;};/** The client-side console is the default logger  */let logger:typeof console;/**\n * @deprecated since 0.8.0\n * You are referencing the FEATURES object which has been deprecated as it is no longer an agreed-upon method for how to track evolution of the Foundry Virtual Tabletop API.
